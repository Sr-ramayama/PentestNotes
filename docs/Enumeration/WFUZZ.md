# Description

As [[GOBUSTER]] wfuzz is another directory brute forcing tool that enables us to discover all the directories or subdomains present in a webserver. It will replace the word FUZZ in the instruction with the given word list.

# Use

## directory Mode

As we did with [[GOBUSTER]], we will enumerate the directories in a webserver but hiding every directory that results in a <font color="red"> 404 </font> error

`wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt --hc 404 https://domain/FUZZ`

## Subdomain Mode

In a complex manner, we will use this command to enumerate all the subdomains present in a webserver.

`wfuzz -c -w top5000.txt -u 'http://target.tld' -H "Host: FUZZ.target.tld"`

But, if it keeps printing <font color="green"> 200 OK </font> you may want to check the Word field meaning that whenever every try it's accepted, it's common to have a page with an error message so, it get's a response and prints a <font color="green"> 200 OK </font> but the word count is very repeated over and over so we can filter those and just focus on the real positive findings . hw (hide words) hc(hide codes)

`wfuzz -c -w top5000.txt -u 'http://target.tld' -H "Host: FUZZ.target.tld" -hw WCOUNT`
