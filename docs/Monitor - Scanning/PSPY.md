# Description

Pspy will let us to monitor executed instructions in a victims machine. We do this to maybe discern any recursive instruction that could be made by the user with a possible vulnerability or any process that could lead to any privilege escalation.

## Use

Firstly we need to download the pspy64 script (already in my kali)

`wget https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64`

We will serve it with out http server (add reference)

In the victim machine we will give it execution permissions to the user and then execute it (recommended in a separate tab)

```
chmod u+x pspy64
./pspy64
```
