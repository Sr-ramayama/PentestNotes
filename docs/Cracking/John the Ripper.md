# Description

John the Ripper is a fast password cracker, currently available for many flavors of Unix, macOS, Windows, DOS, BeOS, and OpenVMS (the latter requires a contributed patch). Its primary purpose is to detect weak Unix passwords. Besides several crypt(3) password hash types most commonly found on various Unix flavors, supported out of the box are Kerberos/AFS and Windows LM hashes, as well as DES-based tripcodes, plus hundreds of additional hashes and ciphers in "-jumbo" versions.

## Hash Cracking

In order to crack a hash we first need it be stored in a file like a .txt file ([[Everyday]]). When that's ready we will head to the cracking.

`john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt`

if later on we want to see if the password is cracked ( it will be outputted when it's ready) we can use something to show the hash password:

`john --show hash.txt`
